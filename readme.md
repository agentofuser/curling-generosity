Here are some thoughts about tipping on Brave. Forgive the occasional
humor/sarcasm. I'm trying to add color. I mean no disrespect.

## Tipping is not a big deal

It is the opposite of a big deal.

And it should be treated that way. Don't cover half my screen with a banner and
offer me to tweet and everything. Just get out of the way as soon as possible
so I can do it again!

Tipping is like:

- Liking
- Faving
- Starring
- Clapping
- Upvoting

It's an impulse action that satisfies a need for gratitude / reciprocity /
gifting.

And it's small enough that it would be tacky to go around promoting yourself
for it. "Hey everyone, I just gave this person 50 cents!" "Oh wow, watch out
Bill Gates, here comes a new challenger!" Not something to write home about.

If you have to choose between making it easier to **tip again** vs _share that
you tipped_, think "tip, don't tell". Let the happy publishers who are seeing
the money come in be your loudspeaker.

People do copy urls and post on their own when the situation affords it, no
need to add friction to enable that use case.

## _At most_ one action (click or keypress)

Tipping in places with their own appreciation / signal-boosting mechanism
should take zero extra actions if the user wants it so.
